# Fashion Shop Java Swing Application

This is a Java Swing application for managing a fashion shop. It allows users to view products, manage stock, and process orders directly from a Java Swing interface.

## How to Run

Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. To run the application:

1. If the `.class` files are already compiled in the `compiled/` directory, simply run:

```
run.bat
```

2. If the `.class` files are not present or need to be updated:
- Run `compile.bat` to compile the Java source files:
  ```
  compile.bat
  ```
- Alternatively, run `compile_and_run.bat` to compile and launch the app in one step:
  ```
  compile_and_run.bat
  ```

Once the application is running, you can interact with the shop system through the application interface.
The shop save data saves in data folder as `orders.txt`. There are already 1000 sample datas in it.
